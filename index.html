        <p class="about__paragraph"><span class="bold">Cryptocurrency</span> is a form of payment that can be exchanged
            online for goods and
            services. Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded
            specifically for the good or service that the company provides. Think of them as you would arcade tokens or
            casino chips. You'll need to exchange real currency for the cryptocurrency to access the good or service.
            Cryptocurrencies work using a technology called <span class="bold">blockchain.</span> Blockchain is a
            decentralized technology spread
            across many computers that manages and records transactions. Part of the appeal of this technology is its
            security.</p>
        <p class="about__paragraph"><span class="bold">More than 2,200 different cryptocurrencies are traded
                publicly,</span> according to
            CoinMarketCap.com, a market research website. And cryptocurrencies continue to proliferate, raising money
            through initial coin offerings, or ICOs. The total value of all cryptocurrencies on June 6, 2019 was about
            $246 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, and the total value of all bitcoins, the most popular digital
            currency, was pegged at about $136 billion.</p>
        <p class="about__paragraph">Cryptocurrencies may go up in value, but many investors see them as mere
            speculations, not real investments. The reason? Just like real currencies, cryptocurrencies generate no cash
            flow, so for you to profit someone has to pay more for the currency than you did.
            That's what's called "the greater fool" theory of investment. Contrast that to a well-managed business,
            which increases its value over time by growing the profitability and cash flow of the operation. For those
            who see cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as the currency of the future, it should be noted that a currency
            needs stability so that merchants and consumers can determine what a fair price is for goods. Bitcoin and
            other cryptocurrencies have been anything but stable through much of their history. For example, while
            bitcoin traded at close to $20,000 in December 2017, its value then dropped to as low as about $3,200 a year
            later. In May 2019 it topped $8,000.</p>
