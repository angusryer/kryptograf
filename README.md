# Kryptograf

## Description
Kryptograf is the fun result of a half-day hack-a-thon through the BrainStation Web Development Diploma program. We had a blast. We decided to create a sleek interface (thanks, Nick) that allows users to see the top ten cryptocurrencies and explore their historical and economic context.
